# Arxiv: discovery

Search, browse, recommend, or discover site content.

This is the terminal contract. The same main Agent must read this exact path with SkillTool immediately before invoking `opencli_execute`. Do not delegate the read or execution.

| Command | State | Effect / risk | Exact structured use | Exact arguments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `search` | `enabled` | `public_read` / `low` | `opencli_execute(site="arxiv", operation="discovery", command="search", arguments={"query":"<query>"})`<br>Search arXiv papers | `query` (str, required, positional); `limit` (int, optional, default=10) |

## Safety and fallback

- Unknown commands and arguments are rejected before subprocess start.
- Arguments are rendered from the frozen catalog schema; no shell, arbitrary argv prefix, executable override, or environment override is accepted.
- These commands are reviewed public reads. A proven pre-dispatch failure and a read failure may use `browser_agent` once; never run both paths concurrently.
