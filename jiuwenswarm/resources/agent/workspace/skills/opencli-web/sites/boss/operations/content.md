# Boss: content

Read site content and metadata.

This is the terminal contract. The same main Agent must read this exact path with SkillTool immediately before invoking `opencli_execute`. Do not delegate the read or execution.

| Command | State | Effect / risk | Exact structured use | Exact arguments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `detail` | `disabled` | `public_read` / `low` | Not executable; use the declared fallback if permitted<br>BOSS直聘查看职位详情 | `security-id` (str, required, positional) |

## Safety and fallback

- Unknown commands and arguments are rejected before subprocess start.
- Arguments are rendered from the frozen catalog schema; no shell, arbitrary argv prefix, executable override, or environment override is accepted.
- A `disabled` or `quarantined` command has documentation but no OpenCLI execution authority. Use only its declared browser fallback.
