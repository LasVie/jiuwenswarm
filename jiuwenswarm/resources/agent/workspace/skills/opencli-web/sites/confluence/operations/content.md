# Confluence: content

Read site content and metadata.

This is the terminal contract. The same main Agent must read this exact path with SkillTool immediately before invoking `opencli_execute`. Do not delegate the read or execution.

| Command | State | Effect / risk | Exact structured use | Exact arguments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `page` | `enabled` | `public_read` / `low` | `opencli_execute(site="confluence", operation="content", command="page", arguments={"id":"<id>"})`<br>Confluence page by id with storage and Markdown body | `id` (str, required, positional) |

## Safety and fallback

- Unknown commands and arguments are rejected before subprocess start.
- Arguments are rendered from the frozen catalog schema; no shell, arbitrary argv prefix, executable override, or environment override is accepted.
- These commands are reviewed public reads. A proven pre-dispatch failure and a read failure may use `browser_agent` once; never run both paths concurrently.
