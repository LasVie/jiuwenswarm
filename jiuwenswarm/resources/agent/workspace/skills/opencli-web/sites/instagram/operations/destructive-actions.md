# Instagram: destructive-actions

Delete, remove, revoke, or perform administrative changes.

This is the terminal contract. The same main Agent must read this exact path with SkillTool immediately before invoking `opencli_execute`. Do not delegate the read or execution.

| Command | State | Effect / risk | Exact structured use | Exact arguments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `collection-delete` | `disabled` | `destructive_or_admin` / `critical` | Not executable; use the declared fallback if permitted<br>Delete an Instagram saved-posts collection (folder) by name or id | `target` (str, required, positional) |
| `unfollow` | `disabled` | `destructive_or_admin` / `critical` | Not executable; use the declared fallback if permitted<br>Unfollow an Instagram user | `username` (str, required, positional) |

## Safety and fallback

- Unknown commands and arguments are rejected before subprocess start.
- Arguments are rendered from the frozen catalog schema; no shell, arbitrary argv prefix, executable override, or environment override is accepted.
- A `disabled` or `quarantined` command has documentation but no OpenCLI execution authority. Use only its declared browser fallback.
- Any operation that may change state, expose private data, write a file, or consume quota is fail-closed after dispatch and cannot be automatically retried through a browser.
