# Uisdc: discovery

Search, browse, recommend, or discover site content.

This is the terminal contract. The same main Agent must read this exact path with SkillTool immediately before invoking `opencli_execute`. Do not delegate the read or execution.

| Command | State | Effect / risk | Exact structured use | Exact arguments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `news` | `enabled` | `public_read` / `low` | `opencli_execute(site="uisdc", operation="discovery", command="news")`<br>优设读报 - 最新 AI/设计行业新闻 | `limit` (int, optional, default=20) |

## Safety and fallback

- Unknown commands and arguments are rejected before subprocess start.
- Arguments are rendered from the frozen catalog schema; no shell, arbitrary argv prefix, executable override, or environment override is accepted.
- These commands are reviewed public reads. A proven pre-dispatch failure and a read failure may use `browser_agent` once; never run both paths concurrently.
